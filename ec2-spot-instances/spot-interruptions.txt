##### signals

Spot Instance interruption notice -- a warning that is issued two minutes before Amazon EC2 stops or terminates your Spot Instance


EC2 Rebalance Recommendation -- a notification when spot instances are at elevated risk of interruption. The signal can arrive sooner than the two-minute Spot Instance interruption notice.Not always though.



##### increase the resilience

- Add an Availability Zone - the EC2 Auto Scaling group is currently deployed in two AZs. By adding an AZ to your application, you will tap into more EC2 Spot capacity pools.
- Add Instance Types - the 6 instance types that are configured in the Auto Scaling group have small performance variability, so itâ€™s possible to run all these instance types in a single ASG and scale on the same dynamic scaling policy.
- Enable Capacity Rebalaning
- Use the Least Outstanding Requests (LOR) load balancing algorithm instead of Round Robin - the load balancer will send it to the target with least number of outstanding requests
- you can also customize Spot interruption notification handling with EventBridge and Lambda
